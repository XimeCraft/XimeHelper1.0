# User Story: File Opening Agent

## **Title:**

As a user, I want to open files on my local computer by describing them in natural language, so that I can quickly access the files I need without manually searching for them.

------

## **User Story Details**

### **Description:**

The file opening agent is a feature of the personal assistant that allows users to input queries in natural language (e.g., "Open my latest report") and have the correct file automatically identified and opened. This saves time and minimizes the need for manual navigation through file directories.

### **Acceptance Criteria:**

1. The system correctly identifies the target file from a query.
2. The system opens the identified file using the appropriate application.
3. If multiple files match the query, the system provides clarification options.
4. If no file matches, the system notifies the user and suggests next steps.

### **Tasks Linked to the User Story:**

1. Implement natural language query parsing.
2. Develop file search and ranking logic.
3. Integrate file-opening functionality with system commands.
4. Design and implement error handling for unmatched or ambiguous queries.
5. Test the system with various file structures and queries.
6. Optimize performance for fast file retrieval and opening.

## **User Journey: File Opening Agent**

### **Stage 1: Query Input**

1. The user launches the personal assistant and selects the "File Opening" function.
2. The user types or speaks a query (e.g., "Open the financial report from last month").

### **Stage 2: Query Processing**

1. The system processes the input using an LLM to extract relevant file details (e.g., file name, date, or type).
2. The system searches the defined directories on the userâ€™s local computer for matching files.
3. If a match is found, the system ranks files by relevance (e.g., modification date, similarity to query).

### **Stage 3: File Identification**

1. If a single matching file is found:
   - The system confirms the match and prepares to open the file.
2. If multiple files match:
   - The system presents a list of options for the user to choose from.
3. If no file matches:
   - The system notifies the user and suggests refining the query.

### **Stage 4: File Opening**

1. The system executes the command to open the file using the appropriate application (e.g., PDF viewer, Word processor).
2. The user gains access to the file and continues their task seamlessly.

### **Stage 5: Post-Action Feedback**

1. The system provides feedback (e.g., "Opened: financial_report_2023.pdf").
2. If any issue occurred, the system logs the error and informs the user with suggested resolutions.

## **Future Enhancements:**

1. Add support for opening cloud-stored files (e.g., Google Drive).
2. Enable natural language query refinement through follow-up questions (e.g., "Do you mean the report from January?").
3. Integrate voice command support for hands-free interaction.
