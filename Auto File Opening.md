# Auto File Opening



## **Overview**

This document outlines the design and implementation of an automated file-opening agent. The agent will allow users to input file-related queries via an LLM-powered interface, identify the requested file, and automatically open it on the user's local system.

------

## **Project Goals**

1. **Primary Objective:**

   - Enable seamless file opening based on natural language input from the user.

2. **Key Features:**

   - Natural language understanding for file queries.

   - Accurate file identification on the local system.

   - Automated file opening with minimal user interven

     tion.

3. **Performance Metrics:**

   - File opening accuracy.
   - Response time under 2 seconds.

------

## **Functional Requirements**

### **1. User Input and Query Handling**

- Features:
  - Accept natural language input to identify the target file.
  - Handle vague queries by requesting clarification.
- Example Inputs:
  - "Open the latest project report."
  - "Show me the file named 'meeting_notes_2024.docx'."

### **2. File Identification**

- Features:
  - Search local directories for matching files.
  - Rank files based on relevance to the query.
- Tech Stack:
  - Python's `os` and `glob` modules for file searching.
  - Optional: Metadata extraction for improved relevance (e.g., file modification date).

### **3. File Opening**

- Features:
  - Automatically open the identified file with the appropriate application.
  - Handle common file types (e.g., `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.xlsx`).
- Tech Stack:
  - Python's `subprocess` or `os.system` for file execution.

### **4. Error Handling and Feedback**

- Features:
  - Notify the user if the file is not found or if multiple matches exist.
  - Suggest refinement queries when ambiguity arises.

------

## **Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Performance:**
   - Identify and open files in under 2 seconds.
2. **Security:**
   - Restrict file access to user-authorized directories.
3. **Usability:**
   - Provide clear feedback for invalid or ambiguous queries.

------

## **Development Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Planning**

- Define supported file types and directories.
- Set up initial query-handling logic.

### **Phase 2: Prototype Development**

- Implement natural language query parsing using an LLM.
- Develop file search and ranking algorithm.
- Integrate basic file-opening functionality.

### **Phase 3: Testing and Iteration**

- Test with various query scenarios and file structures.
- Optimize for speed and accuracy.

### **Phase 4: Deployment**

- Package the agent for local execution.
- Provide user documentation.

------

## **Technical Stack**

- **Programming Language:** Python.
- Libraries and Tools:
  - LLM API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4 or local fine-tuned model).
  - `os`, `subprocess`, `glob` for file operations.
- **Execution Environment:** Local system.

------

## **Acceptance Criteria**

1. **Functionality:**
   - Correctly identifies and opens files based on user queries.
2. **Performance:**
   - Average response time under 2 seconds.
3. **Error Handling:**
   - Provides clear feedback for ambiguous or invalid queries.

------

## **Future Enhancements**

1. Advanced Search Features:
   - Use file content search (e.g., searching within `.txt` or `.docx` files).
2. Integration with Cloud Storage:
   - Allow searching and opening files stored in cloud services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox).
3. User Personalization:
   - Adapt search ranking based on user preferences and history.
