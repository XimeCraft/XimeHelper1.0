# Auto File Management



## **Overview**

The Auto File Management project aims to create an AI-driven system that automates various file management tasks. The system will facilitate seamless interactions between users and their local or cloud-based file systems through natural language commands. By leveraging advanced AI capabilities, the project seeks to enhance productivity by reducing manual file handling.

## **Project Goals**

1. **Primary Objective:**
   - Develop a modular, AI-driven system for automating file-related tasks, including file opening, organization, archiving, and retrieval.
2. **Key Features:**
   - Natural language interface for file interactions.
   - Support for multi-step workflows involving file operations.
   - Scalability to handle large, diverse file systems across local and cloud environments.
3. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Accuracy in task execution (e.g., correct file identification, organization rules).
   - Response time under 2 seconds for typical tasks.
   - High user satisfaction and reduced manual workload.

## **Epics and Functionalities**

### **Epic 1: File Opening**

#### **Description:**

Enable users to open files on their system using natural language commands.

#### **Features:**

- Search for files based on user queries.
- Open files with appropriate applications.
- Handle ambiguous or unmatched queries with suggestions.

### **Epic 2: File Organization**

#### **Description:**

Automatically organize files into folders or categories based on predefined or AI-detected rules.

#### **Features:**

- Detect file types and content for categorization.
- Move files to appropriate folders automatically.
- Allow customization of organization rules.

### **Epic 3: File Archiving**

#### **Description:**

Streamline the archiving process to manage outdated or infrequently accessed files.

#### **Features:**

- Automatically identify files for archiving based on user-defined rules (e.g., last modified date, size).
- Compress and store files in designated archive locations.
- Provide retrieval options for archived files.

### **Epic 4: File Search and Retrieval**

#### **Description:**

Enable fast and accurate retrieval of files using natural language queries.

#### **Features:**

- Support metadata-based and content-based searches.
- Rank results by relevance to the query.
- Handle both local and cloud-based files.

### **Epic 5: File Sharing**

#### **Description:**

Simplify the process of sharing files with others via email, cloud links, or local transfers.

#### **Features:**

- Generate shareable links for cloud files.
- Compress and email local files directly.
- Manage file permissions for shared items.

### **Epic 6: File Cleanup**

#### **Description:**

Help users maintain a tidy file system by identifying and handling unnecessary or duplicate files.

#### **Features:**

- Detect duplicate files or files with low usage frequency.
- Suggest cleanup actions with user confirmation.
- Automate deletion or archiving of selected files.

## **User Stories**

### **Example User Stories by Epic:**

1. **File Opening:**
   - As a user, I want to open files by describing them in natural language so that I donâ€™t have to manually navigate folders.
2. **File Organization:**
   - As a user, I want my documents automatically sorted into categories (e.g., invoices, reports) to save time on manual organization.
3. **File Archiving:**
   - As a user, I want outdated files automatically archived to free up space on my system.
4. **File Search and Retrieval:**
   - As a user, I want to quickly find files by describing their content or metadata.
5. **File Sharing:**
   - As a user, I want to share a file by giving a simple command to generate a shareable link or send an email.
6. **File Cleanup:**
   - As a user, I want duplicate files detected and suggested for deletion to reduce clutter.
